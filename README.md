# RandomAtari
Random Atari Practice and Skill up

Just a repo to hold random homebrew Atari 2600 games/demos. Not using any of the newly developed extensions or hardware.

You will need to download a copy of the vcs.h and macro.h header files from the DASM repo. Once you have those each .asm file can be assembled with DASM.

Once assembled you can run the resulting .bin file on the Stella Emulator.

Press the Game Select Switch to cycle through different games.


## Atari Paint
This is 3 games in one and you can switch between them using the Game Select Switch

### Music Maker
You can create music on the Atari but any creation will be lost if you switch games

### Atari Paint
Toggling the B/W and Color Switch will give you a canvas that has a single color or a single color per row<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B/W - Single Color Canvas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Color - Multi-Color Canvas<br>
*Secret: You can define your own colors in single color mode by selecting different combinations of the first 8 pixels and switching to the multi-color mode. These 8 pixels will define a number that correlates to a color. The color defined will be the same color as the row. Becareful because you cannot select these colors from the palette if you want to edit your art*
