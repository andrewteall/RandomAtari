# RandomAtari
Random Atari Practice and Skill up

Just a repo to hold random homebrew Atari 2600 games/demos. Not using any of the newly developed extensions or hardware.

You will need to download a copy of the vcs.h and macro.h header files from the DASM repo. Once you have those each .asm file can be assembled with DASM.

Once assembled you can run the resulting .bin file on the Stella Emulator.

Press the Game Select Switch to cycle through different games.
